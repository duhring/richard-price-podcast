OK.... How do you suggest we cut up the following... and what images should I create-  Surprise email: my paper becomes an AI-generated podcast
0:00
A day ago, I got an email from
0:04
academia.edu
0:06
informing me that a paper that I had
0:09
written 10 years ago had been turned
0:13
into a podcast, AI generated podcast.
0:18
And when I went in and listened to it,
0:20
the voice was introduced as a founder of
 Wait—that’s Richard Price’s cloned voice!
0:24
the academia.edu.
0:27
And when I checked it mentions that yes
0:31
indeed his voice was cloned and it's
0:35
basically reading papers of academics
0:40
as podcasts. So I recorded mine along
 Why I hit record: today’s agenda
0:45
with walking through the paper just to
0:48
give an idea of what it is in today's
0:51
world. Welcome to another edition of
0:53
In-Depth with Academia, your go-to
0:56
podcast for diving deep into the world
0:58
of academic research and discoveries.

I'm your host, Richard Price, CEO of

Academia.edu.
1:04
And today, we're embarking on a
 Paper overview – **“Project-Based Learning Kickstart Tips”
1:06
fascinating exploration of educational
1:08
technology through the lens of
1:11
hackathons. If you're new here, remember

maybe grab a cup of coffee while you're

at it because today's topic is as
1:20
stimulating as it is significant.
1:24
So, let's get into the heart of the
1:26
matter. The paper we're dissecting today
1:28
written by John During is called
1:31
Projectbased Learning Kickstart Tips:
1:33
Hackathon Pedigogies as Educational
1:35
Technology. I mean, why do hackathons
 Why hackathons matter in education
1:38
matter in education? Isn't that a
1:39
question worth pondering? The crux of
1:41
During's paper addresses how
1:43
face-to-face educational experiences
1:45
like hackathons can complement, perhaps
1:47
even enhance traditional learning
1:49
methods. This isn't about replacing the
1:52
good old classroom. It's about asking
1:55
how do we make learning richer, more
1:57
effective.
 Engagement gains & learning outcomes
1:59
The significance is clear. If we can
2:01
harness these dynamic technologydriven
2:04
environments, the potential for student
2:06
engagement and learning outcomes is
2:08
well, it's pretty significant. The paper
2:11
isn't prescribing hackathons as a
2:12
one-sizefits-all solution. Rather, it
2:15
views them as a catalyzing element in
2:18
academia. It's all about kickstarting
2:21
projects, themes, and interests, giving
2:23
students a platform to shine. Now,
 Not one-size-fits-all: hackathons as catalysts
2:26
listeners, don't misunderstand. This is
2:28
not just about students becoming tech
2:30
wizards overnight. Rather, it's about
2:32
cultivating a culture of learning and
2:35
exploration. Isn't that exciting?
 Teacher 2.0 – facilitator, observer, co-learner
2:39
Now, um let's pause for a moment because
2:43
something during said got me thinking
2:45
about teaching styles. Isn't it funny
2:48
how the more we embrace these new tools,
2:50
the more the role of a teacher evolves
2:52
from a traditional lecturer to a
2:54
facilitator or observer? I mean instead
2:57
of just conveying knowledge, the
2:59
teachers become alongside participants
3:01
observing, guiding and learning
3:03
themselves. This idea of reshaping
3:06
education excites me as during notes
3:09
teachers can use hackathons as a
3:11
benchmark tool to observe students,
3:14
gauge their skills, anticipate
3:16
challenges, and adapt their methods to
3:18
elevate learning like a symphony in its
3:20
crescendo, guided and beautiful. But
 Reality check: planning, chaos vs. structured creativity
3:23
it's not all rainbows and unicorns. The
3:25
reality is execution of hackathons in
3:28
educational curricula requires careful
3:30
planning ensuring the experiences are
3:32
meaningful and well integrated. Are we
3:34
just organizing chaos or is it
3:36
structured creativity? Maybe a dash of
3:38
both.
3:39
There's a certain magic in this ethos of
3:42
self-organization and problem solving
3:45
within a compressed time frame that sets
 The magic of self-organization under pressure
3:48
the stage for learning beyond the
3:50
ordinary. Not to mention, it's a process
3:52
bound to draw out those who might
3:53
typically hang back, encouraging all
3:55
students to discover new areas of
3:57
interests and competencies. Listen, if
 Can hackathon energy fuel semester-long projects?
4:00
hackathons genuinely enhance course
4:01
design and learning objectives, there
4:04
lies immense potential to foster
4:05
creativity and competency in measurable
4:07
ways. During urges us to consider, could
4:11
the intense high energy environment of a
4:13
hackathon be leveraged to foster
4:16
long-term course projects, thus
4:17
anchoring courses in real world
4:19
challenges? as it's an open question,
4:21
but certainly food for thought. As we
 Innovation ✕ tradition: the ongoing waltz
4:24
wind down today's exploration, remember
4:27
folks, academic research, like During's
4:29
paper, is about presenting paradigms to
4:32
consider, not irrefutable truths.
4:35
There's a waltz occurring between
4:36
innovation and tradition. Hackathons
4:39
offer a fresh lens, and while this paper
4:41
doesn't provide all the answers or a
4:43
guaranteed path, it plants the seeds for
4:45
further inquiry and adaptation.
4:48
Isn't that what good research is all
4:50
about? So, let's keep the discourse
 Let’s keep the discourse lively—join the conversation
